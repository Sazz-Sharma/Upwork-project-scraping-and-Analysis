Fix website issues,"['Website', 'Website Redesign', 'Elementor', 'WordPress']",$500.00,"Website Running on Child Theme instead of Parent Theme: Using a WordPress child theme is discouraged for various reasons, such as its challenging learning curve, potential to diminish website speed, and the requirement for coding expertise. These factors often result in code merging or confusion for Google crawlers, affecting the webpage's perceived value. So as per Google Suggestion Child Themes, especially on wordpress should be avoided. Website Speed: Mobile: Desktop: If your website doesn't load quickly, the bad news is that you're losing visitors. People aren't willing to wait anymore. Even worse, slow websites often finish well below faster ones in search results. This means that visitors see your competitors' sites before yours. AI Content: Google doesn't rank content solely based on AI technology. Instead, Google's search ranking systems reward high-quality content that demonstrates expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. Google's spam policies prohibit using automation, including AI, to generate content primarily for the purpose of manipulating search rankings. Google has developed sophisticated algorithms that can detect and filter out AI-generated content to ensure high-quality search results. These measures include analyzing the language patterns, user behavior, and other statistical factors to determine the authenticity of the content. H1 Tags Missing: The absence of adequate customization options within the theme settings makes it challenging to resolve the missing H1 tag error. Editing Problem: Due to Child theme some plugins are not working as they should be one of the issue you can see in the above snippet which is not allowing to make edits properly. üëç (It‚Äôs Prefered to have Lite Themes like: Generate press for your website) Missing Meta Field: https://bossfacts.com/blog https://bossfacts.com/category/digital-marketing https://bossfacts.com/category/graphic-design-assets https://bossfacts.com/category/software-tools https://bossfacts.com/category/-developer https://bossfacts.com/category/-hosting-and-domain-services https://bossfacts.com/category/website-builder These URLs seems to be missing their Meta Data which is one of the important factor to get rank. Broken Links: In the footer section, the About, Privacy Policy, Advertise, and Contact tabs do not lead to their respective pages. Social Tabs not Linked: Social Tabs in the Footer Section are not linked to Website‚Äôs own Social Media Account, instead they‚Äôre linked to Theme‚Äôs General Social Media and Google Crawler can mark this activity as spam so immediate action is required here. Missing ALT Atributies: Most images on your website are missing ALT text. If there is no attribute some screen readers will compensate and read the path to the image instead, which will often give no value to the end user. If you are using a CMS (Content Management System), the default setting should be that an empty alt attribute is added to all images."

Multiple locations for a single listing in wordpress,"['Web Development', 'MariaDB', 'WordPress', 'PHP', 'JavaScript', 'HTML']",$100.00,"Hello! We are in the process of building a teacher swap website using the WordPress Voxel theme (https://getvoxel.io/). Our site aims to connect teachers looking to swap their teaching locations by listing their current location and preferred swap destinations. The Voxel theme has been a great foundation for us, especially with its integrated location fields using Google Maps and the ability to filter search results by location (postcode, city, address, etc.). However, we've encountered a limitation that we need your expertise to overcome. Project Overview: We require a custom WordPress plugin that extends the functionality of the Voxel theme‚Äôs location fields. Currently, users can specify a single location for where they are based and another for where they would like to go. Our need is for a multilocation filter feature that allows users to add multiple preferred destinations. For example, a teacher living in Madrid might want to swap to Barcelona, Sevilla, Malaga, etc. This feature should integrate seamlessly with Google Maps and enable filtering across all specified locations with a single query in our search results page. Current issue: - why not use repeater field? - because we can't filter the fields inside the repeater field - why not using 3 or 4 individual location fields? - because it's not possible to have 1 filter that goes through multiple locations fields. - why not create multiple listings and just change the location? - because users are the one adding the listing, and they won't create 4 different listings just to change a location"

Seeking Expert to Streamline WordPress Publishing Process - Fixing Block Editor Integration,"['Web Development', 'WordPress', 'Website & CMS Bug Fix']",$150.00,"About Us: We are a scaling B2B fintech company in the financial data industry serving US-based businesses. Specifically, we're bridging old and new with modern tech for the traditional credit industry. Situation and Ask: We're currently using Letterdrop, a headless CMS, to push blogs to WordPress through an API integration. However, due to WordPress API limitations, our blog posts end up in the Classic Editor instead of the Block Editor we're used to. This causes issues with margins and styling that can be manually fixed but require time after each post is published. We need help to ensure a smooth publishing process from Letterdrop to WordPress without the need for these manual adjustments. We've identified two possible solutions: Adjusting the format within the Classic Editor to match the margins and style of the Block Editor to avoid the need for manual editing after publishing each article. Fixing the non-functional ""Convert to Blocks"" button, which currently doesn't do anything when clicked. Option A is preferable as it simplifies the publishing workflow, eliminating the need for post-publication editing in WordPress. Budget and Duration: The amount for the completion of this task is $150 USD and estimated completion time is 1 to 2 hours (including testing)."

An added benefit for musicians is learning how to deconstruct music and provide effective feedback for others which will also subconsciously improve their own writing. About me, how I work and Requirements: I have 15 years experience in managing products (SAAS) solutions and 10 years of Javascript, PHP and MySQL experience with some angular and Vue. This project has a solution presentation where I discuss the nature of the website. I also have a functional requirements document, ERD, sample data, user stories, wireframes, logic workflows, user journeys and design criteria. My requirements are extremely detailed, and my being an experienced product manager and agile project manager should help with the process.

We are in the process of building a teacher swap website using the WordPress Voxel theme (https://getvoxel.io/). Our site aims to connect teachers looking to swap their teaching locations by listing their current location and preferred swap destinations. The Voxel theme has been a great foundation for us, especially with its integrated location fields using Google Maps and the ability to filter search results by location (postcode, city, address, etc.). However, we've encountered a limitation that we need your expertise to overcome. Project Overview: We require a custom WordPress plugin that extends the functionality of the Voxel theme‚Äôs location fields. Currently, users can specify a single location for where they are based and another for where they would like to go. Our need is for a multilocation filter feature that allows users to add multiple preferred destinations. For example, a teacher living in Madrid might want to swap to Barcelona, Sevilla, Malaga, etc. This feature should integrate seamlessly with Google Maps and enable filtering across all specified locations with a single query in our search results page. Current issue: - why not use repeater field? - because we can't filter the fields inside the repeater field - why not using 3 or 4 individual location fields? - because it's not possible to have 1 filter that goes through multiple locations fields. - why not create multiple listings and just change the location? - because users are the one adding the listing, and they won't create 4 different listings just to change a location"

Build a Shopify App for merchant to connect their data to an ETL pipeline and view dashboards,"['TypeScript', 'API Integration', 'Shopify Apps', 'JavaScript', 'Shopify', 'Remix']",$500.00,"We are looking for a skilled Shopify application developer to create an application that enables secure connectivity to merchant websites to perform data download via external ETL tools and then display analytics dashboards. The primary goal of this application is to retrieve ""offline access tokens"" created during the app installation, and then store the access_token into a remote db, with the app posting session information (including the access_token) to a rest endpoint that will persist the session information independantly of the shopfiy app. The endpoint URL should be configurable. Once the app is installed and the offline access token is stored, we build the UI for the logged-in merchant user. In this first iteration of the project, the main view will just be a panel with text and a button to link to our external app (passing the merchant store url). The external app will let the merchant login and see their dashboard. In the next iteration of this project (not now), we will embed a ready made dashboard (https://www.gooddata.com/docs/gooddata-ui/latest/learn/embed_dashboards/embed_dashboards/). A critical point will be the authentication process between the shopify app view to the GoodData service, but this is something we want to investigate further and therefore is phase 2 (not in scope right now). Core Responsibilities: - Develop a Shopify application that can capture access tokens from merchant websites during the installation process. - Implement functionality within the application to securely transmit the retrieved access tokens, along with merchant shop ID and other session information, to our specified endpoint using a POST request (we provide a dev enpoint for this). - Ensure that the transmitted data in JSON can be stored in a database. - Ensure the app we are building can become a public app on shopify store (compliant with Shopify TOS for apps). - Collaborate closely with our team to understand our data handling requirements and provide recommendations for efficient shopifu app architecture. Ideal Candidate: - Proficient in Shopify application development, with a strong understanding of access token handling and secure data transmission methods. - Ability to work independently and offer creative solutions to technical challenges. - Excellent communication skills. - Nice to have: experience with AWS services, especially in data storage solutions. Project Deliverables: - A fully functional Shopify application that meets the described requirements, developped with the latest shopify SDK (Remix). - Deployment instruction for hosting the application and allow its installation by any merchant. Timeline: Please provide an estimated timeline for the completion of the project based on the scope described. Budget: Indicate your budget range for this project."

PDF.js isn't built with this in mind out-of-the-box, but it is possible to use in this manner with some tweaks and modifications by somebody with some additional time and expertise. This requirement comes from a client of ours who needs to run their own PDF reader from within an index.html file on computers without access to the internet. The solution should allow for a PDF base64 string (an example of this approach is available on the official documentation) to be loaded into the page, with the default viewer running as normal with all features enabled and functioning. Configuration parameters and variables should all be explicitly set outside of the PDF.js files. In simple terms, your solution should let somebody double click a index.html file which locally loads a pre-processed PDF (e.g. as a Uint8Array, which in your example can be inline for demo purposes) into a correctly initialised default viewer of PDF.js, on a browser with no internet access. The successful implementation will eventually be integrated into a wider bespoke application that uses Eleventy and Parcel for bundling, so it would be ideal if this is the approach followed in your example application scaffold (however this is optional should time constraints apply). You can statically build your version of PDF.js with the required changes, however ideally your solution would act as a wrapper around the current PDF.js distribution files as-is. This task is ideal for somebody who has had experience working with PDF.js in this way before, or who generally loves tinkering with JavaScript problems with this kind of fixed scope. We don't think this should take more than a day or two for somebody who knows what they're doing."

What you would be doing: ‚Ä¢ I need you to create a Custom Product Type for the Lessons that is Bookable (Appointment), has Availability set to them that can be modified and personalized with sets of rules (like different price depending on the time of the Season, different price per the amount(Individuals or Groups) and type of persons(Adults or Kids), and is synchronized with the rest of availability of the other Lessons of the Instructor (the Lessons are given in real life at a certain Time and Place where the Client and Instructor meet, so Its only a Virtual product representing the Appointment set for a specific Date and Time Slot, that once is booked, it shows unavailable on the other Lessons (products)). ‚Ä¢ I need you to help me set the filter system for the Archive where Customers can search for both the Instructors(shown with cards, like Pokemons, that link to their Profiles(stores) or for the Lessons (also shown as Cards containing certain Info and that link to the Lesson Page (Single Product Page Template). More exactly I need you to help me or show me how could I link certain Categories/Taxonomies (predefined by me) to the Instructor/Lessons so the Customers can select them and it fetches in the Database, showing the Instructors/Lessons that match those requirements and that are available for the Date and Location that the Customer has set on the search. So, after all this: It is basically helping me finishing the project. I got understanding of Wordpress, I understand PHP (with knowledge in OOP and MVC Pattern Design), HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript. I just do not have enough time to dig and learn enough to code everything for myself from scratch and create/implement the logic for that type of product and I would appreciate some help and guidance in modifying what I need in the Wordpress Files to achieve that. (Maybe we could create a Plugin that contains the Lesson Product Type so we avoid messing it too much and prevent errors and incompatibilities in further Wordpress updates) Also for now it's a One-Man project so I need to focus in other areas such as Marketing, Finances, Sales, Copywriting, Design and all the other complex areas that, as you know, a Business requires. (Eventhough I really enjoy the Programming part and hope to delegate in the future so I can dig more in it). What you get out of this: ‚Ä¢ Obviously the economical compensation, that now is more a token of appreciation for your help, but in the future It will evolve in a stable and more lucrative business relationship between you and me if we get along and work good together (and you believe in the project, which I think you'll love once I explain you the scalability process that I have set) ‚Ä¢ The opportunity to get involved in an Industry changing project with prospects of becoming an essential part of it. Sound too typical but I don't want to explain all the Magic Sauce to the wrong candidate. ‚Ä¢ You'll be gaining an amazing amount of good Karma and Life Purpose by helping me and even teaching me in the pursuit of my Vision (that I hope it becomes ours). I'm devoted to those who wholeheartedly and compassionately help me in my way, and I always try to pay back all the value and support that those around me share with me. I strongly believe in meaningful human relationships and connections so I'll make sure that you get what you give. If this sounds appealing to you, please get in touch and I'll explain you the full details of the project so you can decide if you feel like taking part in it. Also if you think there is an easier and straightforward to do what I ask just let me know, I'm more than open to changes and adjustments. P.S: I know Woocomerce Bookings and other similar plugins exists but I've tried them and they do not exactly fit my needs in the way I want them. Also one of the key features is Two-Way Google Calendar Synchronization (it can come in the future tho, first thing first) and those plugins do not have them or are not suitable for a Multivendor Marketplace environment)"

Full Stack Developer for Responsive Web App [#7],"['React', 'Redux', 'GraphQL', 'NestJS', 'PostgreSQL', 'REST API', 'Figma']","$1,000.00","Hi Upworkers! We're looking for a highly skilled full stack developer with excellent development and communication skills to undertake one of our projects as part of a fixed price engagement. You will need to be able to work both autonomously and in collaboration with the project lead throughout the project. Please note that any responses/cover letters to this posting copy pasted or generated by AI will be disregarded without review. Please spare just a couple of minutes to write a succinct response to our posting and note that we will be discussing our project in more depth in a meeting with shortlisted candidates before the official contract is established, to ensure we find the right fit. The project we're developing has a handful of screens in Figma both for desktop and mobile versions of our website. You will be required to: - Convert the screens from Figma to code. The output should look like the design, with any adjustments made as required for varying screen sizes (responsiveness) between the desktop and mobile examples provided. - Use React/Redux/Typescript for this project for the frontend. You should follow atomic design principles to ensure the components created are re-usable. - Use Nest for the backend. The frontend should communicate with the backend using GraphQL (e.g. Apollo/Relay). For payments, you may need to integrate with a provider using REST (i.e. Stripe). We intend to use Postgres for the database. - Develop a limited backend to provide the ability to update products on the website and view/edit customers/orders/invoices etcetera (i.e.basic CRUD). - Write clean, secure and maintainable code. For this stage of the project, users will be completing one-time purchases of a product through a guest-style checkout. - Provide regular updates to the project lead and make adjustments where required. This includes addressing formatting/styling and security issues we may identify. - Support our deployment of this solution to staging/production environments using a Cloud service (i.e. AWS) - Interact with an existing provisioning REST API to deploy the product, then use the information returned to generate and send customers their invoice/product information PDF by email. To help you in providing your proposals for this engagement: - There are 2 unique pages for the site (homepage + product page). A few other pages exist, but reuse the same components from these two screens. Additionally, there are around 7 or so modals (selecting language/currency, cookies acceptance, basic shopping cart, viewing product details). The mobile version has the same content but a slightly modified design to adapt for mobile (such as consolidating a modal into 2 tabs of a drawer). - The checkout flow consists of a checkout page (order summary + payment), a confirmation page (displaying order details and a link to download the invoice) and a 2 page invoice (displaying the order details in PDF form, as well as a page with instructions on accessing the digital product we‚Äôre selling (QR code + text). If you are interested in this posting, please hand-type a brief introduction and respond to the questions we‚Äôve posed. A reminder that this is a fixed-price engagement request. A successful candidate who completes the project effectively will almost certainly be provided with several more opportunities in future, depending on their performance and communication. If part of a team/agency, you may still apply - but please clearly specify this, along with what working with your agency would mean for our project (for example, you‚Äôre a business manager with a senior and junior developer and a QA analyst which would be assigned to our project). Note that this example isn‚Äôt related to our requirements - and a solo full stack developer could undertake this project just as successfully (quality over quantity!). [DEV#6]"

For Payment we will be using Stripe Connect (this allows to connect two parties to a stripe account so the Event Creator gets paid and we can take a processing fee) For the Seatmap I am open but I think a tool like this is perfect: https://seatmap.alisait.com/ I have most of the project in a Figma. Please send me at least 2 Laravel Admin Dashboard or booking LIVE applications including logins if necessary. Then I will provide you with the Figma."

Duplicate a similar website that collects basic data,"['Web Development', 'Web Design']",$900.00,"I am an independent paint supplier to the residential house painting business and I have purchased the URL: www.FindAHousePainter.com whereby a homeowner keys in their zip code and extracts from a database local house painters he can contact directly to give him a quote on painting his house. There is currently a similar website for plumbers (FindAPlumber.com), however it is not operational but apparently was the same type of site I'd like to create for house painters. HOW IT WORKS: 1) House painters across the USA would be contacted by email or postcard asking them to register their FREE account whereby they complete a CGI script asking for basic information. To get a free listing, they must have a current website (or a facebook page) that potential customers can refer to. That information is stored in a database not seen by the customer. As new entries come in, that information goes directly into the database. I would have the ability to manually filter-out companies who are not house painters. 2) On the homepage, the customer enters their zip code and a radius of how far out should the search go, and when doing so, a number of local house painters appears on his screen. 3) On the site, it will be recommended that the homeowner visit some of the painter's website and then contact 3-4 results and follow-up with that paint company. There would be some incidental information provided on the homepage, terms and conditions, etc. provided as we get closer to publishing the site."

"Real Estate Agent Directory front end and B2B agent-to-agent referral back end website,","['Web Development', 'WordPress', 'HTML']","$1,000.00","Update to this project, I have had three developers work on this none of them understood what was needed. I've been ripped off of a lot of money and now I am sitting here after a year and it's still not done in the current developer has been stuck for a month and is also taken more money I need somebody to go in there and look at this first and see what the current developer is done and tell me exactly and guarantee me 100%, how long it would take for them to finish this project that supposedly is 80% done and I need a complete fair price I have paid over $4,000 and I'm not willing to pay any more than $500 to complete it I have installed much of what is needed and configured it, I need a trusting fast expert who can get the rest of this done for me. I can help as well. I can do some of the design, but I need help with the page layout, and I want it all element style. I have installed BuddyBoss, Directory Listings, Geodirectory, Advertising, and Getpaid. Or Ill get what you say I need to make it work. The last version took 4 months and delivered 50% of what I wanted but the backend pages are amature looking other than the front I did and logos I did The purpose of the Agent Listing Service is to bring Real Estate Professionals, including lawyers and Consumers, together. Realtors develop their own tracked referral network and consumers where they can search for a realtor in the area they are moving. This is to be a worldwide system. Ther search will function the same for Realtor and Consumer. It starts off as a Map View where they can zoom in on a state or Country and either continue to drill down till, they see someone they want or to then to a search by Company name, personas name, city, state, zip code, license number. Consumers will be very easy and not have any further functionality other than a directory. I would like to be able to track consumers activity as they click on different realtors so I can supply stats to them Initially the listings will be free and expire within a few months or set time. Realtors need to be able to come to the site and claim their listing and keep it free or upgrade it to a paid listing which there will be different levels, in those levels there will be a matter of less or more details allowed in fields about your business as well as highlighted or featured on other pages of the site, as well as images etc all different based on the level. There would be a payment system integrated for subscriptions. Free listings can not be edited, when it‚Äôs a paid listing they will have access to edit and update their listings. The listing needs to have all the form fields, as well as social media links, review links and ratings from other Realtors that are done in the referral process. Within the paid listing Realtors will be able to form a community of other realtors that they are networking with and be able to communicate internally, share files and get signatures on them via WP Forms. There should be a calendar system for them to mark dates and something to track their referral dollars. I would also want a job board for realtors that want to recruit other realtors. There should be an advertising system so I can sell ad space to other businesses within cities and states, this also needs to be nitrated with a payment system. I want to have the front end editable so I can make changes I also need a mail system so I can send bulk emails to people and subscribers. This is the bones of it I might need to change or add features after this is done later. Anything you can think of that will make what I want to do better is welcomed. I have purchased to integrated GEO directory, BuddyBoss and Directory listings. these should all be able to accomplish hats needed and I know my way around WP so I can also help this job. I need it done in 2 weeks and I need someone that keeps their word and works with pride and efficiency. Most important is I have a database I paid for that I need to have populated to create the initial listings with the fields that have been uploaded via CSV, then they need to populate onto the Map Search. Most important I need this to be responsive elementor style and effects and be able to run and edit this on my own. I need this to look sharp, function very well, some things have changed and I can discuss them, such as having the consumer side of the site a sub domain and split. I need this fixed fast its made me look badly. Here is what we have so far (link removed)/ and (link removed)/ you will see its not good and they just sent me an email that it was all done.

Our site aims to connect teachers looking to swap their teaching locations by listing their current location and preferred swap destinations. The Voxel theme has been a great foundation for us, especially with its integrated location fields using Google Maps and the ability to filter search results by location (postcode, city, address, etc.). However, we've encountered a limitation that we need your expertise to overcome. Project Overview: We require a custom WordPress plugin that extends the functionality of the Voxel theme‚Äôs location fields. Currently, users can specify a single location for where they are based and another for where they would like to go. Our need is for a multilocation filter feature that allows users to add multiple preferred destinations. For example, a teacher living in Madrid might want to swap to Barcelona, Sevilla, Malaga, etc. This feature should integrate seamlessly with Google Maps and enable filtering across all specified locations with a single query in our search results page. Current issue: - why not use repeater field? - because we can't filter the fields inside the repeater field - why not using 3 or 4 individual location fields? - because it's not possible to have 1 filter that goes through multiple locations fields. - why not create multiple listings and just change the location? - because users are the one adding the listing, and they won't create 4 different listings just to change a location"

For example, we could do this using product IDs, so we are able to change the sorting. - since we only have bracelets and keychains the homepage is not so extensive than the original page. We mainly need a header image, 2 boxes for the categories, the product listing mentioned above and the service boxes (FAIR & SUSTAINABLE, Shipping, Service and so on) Category Template: - The layout should resemble this example: [URL ON REQUEST] - Essentially, we want a header image at the top followed by a text area and then the list of products. Product Template (Bracelet): - We need support for variable products with different sizes. - The ""right size function"" won't be necessary. - Please ensure that the animations of the bracelets are built in. Each bracelet will have its own set of images. Currently, we've implemented this using ACF in WooCommerce along with Custom JS/CSS, which we'll provide for reference. Product Template (Keychain): - The format should mirror what's seen on the original page, for example:[URL ON REQUEST] We're eager to collaborate with you in the long run and create an engaging shopping experience for our new audience. We are searching for an Shopify Expert ideally with Woocommerce experience that can answer all our Shopify questions. Thank you for taking on this project with us! Best regards, Nailik"

DEVELOPER for Email Opt-in form setup needed for auto-responder campaign (advanced),"['Web Development', 'Email Campaign Setup', 'Mailchimp', 'Email Marketing', 'Constant Contact', 'Shopify', '', '+1']","$999,999.00","Hi, we need to setup an email opt-in form for an auto-responder campaign. We say ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù in the job title because it‚Äôs not just a simple name/email sign up form and that‚Äôs it. A client would need to sign up with name, email, ‚Äústart date‚Äù (calendar to click the day) and ‚Äúwhat day are you on‚Äù (drop down menu). SEE THIS EXAMPLE: CleanProgram.com/start Here‚Äôs how simple this upwork job description is: We need that EXACT same form setup (except for that ‚Äúwhich cleanse are you doing‚Äù field) with identical step-by-step functioning from start to finish. Easy enough job description, yes? Can you do it? If so, apply! IMPORTANT: We do recommend before you apply to sign up on the Clean link with a dummy email to see the step-by-step process from start to finish so you‚Äôre 100% confident you can do it‚Ä¶ especially the ‚Äúwhat day are you on‚Äù and the client being able to change that at any time and the correct auto-responder email is sent to them when they do change it. Why? This field is here because if someone signs up with their start date and for whatever reason needs to change their date, it needs to be AUTOMATED that they can do it‚Äîotherwise an email system like, say, Mailchimp, will show them a message ‚Äúyou‚Äôre already subscribed‚Äù and they reach a dead end, right? Then we have to go in and manually remove that person's email from the autoresponder campaign list, they have to re-sign back up, etc etc.. it‚Äôs clunky, inefficient, not automated. SOME MORE DETAILS: -As for email program / backend setup: Mailchimp, Constant Contact or other you recommend is fine. We have mailchimp now, but willing to change if you recommend a better service (are you able to tell from the Clean www code what service they are using for their setup?). -As for the front end design, something simple like the Clean example is fine with basic text and the fields to fill out (we‚Äôll provide you this text). -As for the auto-responder emails, there are 29 of them (7 pre-protocol and 21 on-protocol and 1 final congrats-type email). For the purpose of this form setup task and testing all the functioning works correctly, you can just setup the 29 auto-responders with ‚Äúemail 1‚Äù ‚Äúemail 2‚Äù ‚Äúemail 3‚Äù all the way to ‚Äúemail 29‚Äù and we can go in and update all the text, images and links ourselves after the task is complete. -As for where the form needs to be hosted.. we prefer Shopify, but also have a Wordpress site. The Clean site example is in Shopify. So in summary, the job is simple: Can you recreate that Clean sign up form example? If so, please apply! And when you do, please give us an idea of time/cost (fixed price) and when you can get started. We‚Äôre looking to hire someone by the middle of the week and have this all setup and working by the weekend. One last thing, when you apply please put the word ""clean"" at the top of your application so we know you've read this far, are 100% confident on what needs to be done, and are not a bot response. If you have any questions for us regarding the task, don't hesitate to ask! Thanks!"

Development of a Simple HTML5 Hybrid App for Amazon Firestick,"['HTML5', 'Amazon']","$1,000.00","I am seeking a skilled developer to create a streamlined HTML5 Hybrid App specifically designed for the Amazon Firestick. This app will serve as a portal for our web service, facilitating access to web content via a URL. The app's primary function is to authenticate users and display personalized content from our server, leveraging API data provided in JSON format. Core Functionality Requirements: User Authentication: Upon installing the app, users will be prompted to enter a username and password. This information will be verified against our server to authenticate the user and retrieve account details. Login screen: https://www.MyScreenExplains.com/2024-03-24_114418.jpg Main Interface: After successful login, users will be presented with the app's main screen. This interface will display information retrieved through our API, formatted in JSON, including: - A logo or image. - Multiple rows of display data, each containing three variables: Display Name, Program Name, and a Display URL. JSON data: https://www.MyScreenExplains.com/2024-03-24_115217.jpg Main interface: https://www.MyScreenExplains.com/2024-03-24_114543.jpg Content Display: Users will navigate the interface and select content to view. Upon selection, the app will render the associated URL in a full-screen browser mode without visible browser elements. Persistent Display Mode: While viewing content in full-screen mode, the application must prevent the screen or TV from entering sleep mode, ensuring continuous display. Navigation: Users must have the ability to return to the main screen of the app by pressing the back button on the Firestick remote while in full-screen mode. Pre-developed Components: It's important to note that the HTML5 pages for both the login and display screens have already been developed. The primary requirement for this project is the creation of an application wrapper (or a similar solution) that enables these pages to be seamlessly integrated and functional on the Amazon Firestick platform. Unless modifications to these existing HTML5 pages are necessary for integration or enhancement purposes, the focus should remain on developing the app wrapper. Ideal Candidate: The ideal candidate for this project should have extensive experience in developing HTML5 hybrid applications, particularly for the Amazon Firestick platform. Familiarity with user authentication processes, API integration, and creating seamless, user-friendly interfaces is crucial. Additionally, the ability to work efficiently and communicate effectively for any clarifications or adjustments is highly valued. Marketplace Submission Guidance: Additionally, we seek expertise and guidance in navigating the submission process for the Amazon Firestick marketplace. This includes advice on meeting all required standards and criteria for acceptance, ensuring a smooth and successful app submission. Assistance in this area is highly valued and considered part of the project scope. Clarification and Collaboration: Candidates who possess experience with Amazon Firestick app development and are familiar with the platform's submission guidelines will be given preference. We appreciate open communication and collaboration, especially regarding any necessary adjustments or insights that could improve the app's functionality or marketability. We encourage interested developers to highlight their experience with similar projects and their familiarity with the Amazon Firestick marketplace in their proposals. Your expertise in bringing our service to the Amazon Firestick platform is crucial, and we look forward to your guidance and collaboration. Prospective candidates are encouraged to reach out with any questions or to discuss the project in further detail. Please provide a brief overview of your experience and why you believe you are a good fit for this project.

Please see the attachment for reference. For start I'd need a (relatively complex) main page built. - **This is frontend only - need just the SPA. Backend is done separately** - **You can assume APIs are ready. if not - mocking them is OK ** Core set of technologies: - Vue3 / Nuxt3 / TailwindCSS / Pinia - Currently using NuxtUI components - Monaco Editor What needs to be done: - Reworking login page a bit (currently application doesn't know the token expired, etc). Firebase auth is used. - Implement content browser on the left + possibility to open the files in the main editor (similar to vscode), edit them, save them, etc. Right now this only needs to be done for textual files (mockup has few other types but they can be ignored) - Hooking up actions to the backend (execute query, see results, etc) **More details - see attached reference images** here's the core functionality I need: - Should have vs-code like experience (not as complex though - I just need editor tabs + resizable panels) - Main nav should be collapsible + additional collapsible panel on the left (see reference 2) Login page: - Currently it's possible to login with google/github - Only change needed here is to take care of token expiration issue (e.g. redirect user to login if token refresh is not possible) - User can belong to multiple organization - one can be selected by default, profile dropdown can be used to change the organization (effectively a page refresh, etc) Tree nav - Left tree navigation needs to be implemented - adding / renaming / deleting queries - Adding / renaming / deleting projects - searching the content Main editor: - Should use Monaco - Should have tabbed interface (similar to vscode) each tab should have it's own history stack - should be able to close open files - should see the status (spinning indicator) on the tab if the query is being executed Database selector: - dropdown to select a database (contains icon + name) Save / Run buttons: - Save saves the query - Run calls the API to execute the query. It's necessary to implement calling the API + displaying the results. This process is async - for now checking if the query is done can be implemented by polling the API, in the future this will be done via sockets. Profile dropdown: - Should display organizations of the user + selecting currently active organization (this information is returned via API) - Should be able to log out Schema viewer (reference 2) - Shows the schema of currently scelected database - Can be filtered by searching (local search) - Can be refreshed using a button - Should show database schema + column name/type --- Milestones: M1: Page skeleton (left nav, monaco, results) + resizable panels, no functionality is needed other than empty editor + empty results M2: Implement content tree on the left + tabbed editor interface M3: Schema viewer + saving and running the queries M4: Mock chart view Possibly this will turn into ongoing work as I'll need more features developed in frontend as they go.

Custom Wheel similar to Wheel of Names Connected to DB to track Winners,"['Web Development', 'MongoDB', 'JavaScript', 'MERN Stack']",$300.00,"The Project: A Winner Selection Website I'm aiming for a small, secure website where we can pick daily winners in a cool way. Here's the basic rundown: Simple But Secure Login: Just a few users need access, but let's make the login solid ‚Äì 2FA and strong passwords are a must. Vuexy as a Base: I'm digging the look of Vuexy (https://themeforest.net/item/vuexy-vuejs-html-laravel-admin-dashboard-template/23328599). Its pre-built stuff seems like a perfect launchpad. Wheel of Names Vibes: The core of the site is basically a fancy ""Wheel of Names"" (https://wheelofnames.com/). Discord List Cleanup: Users paste in a Discord list, and I've got some code to strip out everything but the names. Easy button to add those cleaned-up names to the wheel. Winner Tracking: We'll keep tabs on who wins, how often, and when their last win was. The winning name gets a little shoutout with their history. Name Matching: If we have two names like ""Sarah/John,"" the system should check if either name exists. New user or an update to an existing one? Database View (AG Grid?): I've got an AG Grid license, so something like that would be great for visualizing the data. The main user accounts will be separate from the winner data. It seems Vuexy has some UI table/grid built in already that may be enough so we don't need the weight of the grid. Database Fields: Users: Name, Email, Password (with password resets) Winners: Name One, Name Two, Wins (as an array), Last Win Date Tech Stuff (Flexible): My team knows MERN, but we're swamped right now. It'd be awesome if you could handle the initial buildout (using Git, of course). That way, we can easily take over for updates later. Timeline and Other Stuff This is a personal project, so no crazy deadline. Obviously, faster is better for everyone! üòâ I'm open to discussing this in more detail ‚Äì even whipping up some mockups if it helps. The Main Tasks: Get that Wheel Spinning: That's the fun core feature! Vuexy Foundation: Set up the login, dashboard look, etc. User Management: Basic add/edit for those limited user accounts. Database View: Let us see and edit the winner records. Thanks, Chris"

Backend Inventory Optimization Tool for Health Food Retail Business,['Python'],"$1,500.00","Project Description: We seek an experienced Python developer to create a custom backend application to optimize inventory management across our health food stores. This application will analyze inventory data to generate efficient stock transfers between stores, aiming to reduce overall inventory levels, improve inventory turns, and enhance profitability. A simple GUI for uploading and downloading Excel files is required, but there's no need for complex interface design or system integration. Objectives: - Reduce perpetual inventory on hand company-wide. - Improve inventory turns across all stores. - Minimize the need for external orders by optimizing internal stock transfers. - Increase profitability through better inventory management. Key Functionalities: Data Import and Management: Ability to import inventory data from an Excel spreadsheet via a simple GUI. The spreadsheet contains detailed information for approximately 3,000 products across separate tabs for each store location. Analysis for Stock Transfers: - Scenario 1: Identify when a receiving store is below their minimum inventory level for a product and suggest a suitable donor store for transfer. Determine the optimal transfer quantity without depleting the donor store. - Scenario 2: Identify when a donor store has excess inventory above its maximum level and suggest suitable receiving stores. Optimize the transfer to enhance inventory turns company-wide. - Scenario 3: Manage discontinued items by recommending transfers to stores where the product can be sold through the quickest at regular price. - Scenario 4: Slow-moving Inventory: Identify and suggest redistribution of slow-moving items to stores where they perform better. - User Interface: A simple, user-friendly interface for loading data, initiating analysis, and viewing recommendations. - Flexibility and Scalability: The application should easily adapt to changes in inventory size, store number, or other operational parameters. - Output Generation: Provide a download link to an Excel file (or files) with detailed recommendations for stock transfers, including product descriptions, quantities, and target stores. - User Interface: A straightforward interface that allows users to upload the input Excel file and download the resulting analysis. The GUI can be very basic, focusing on functionality over design. Skills and Experience Required: - Proficiency in Python, especially with data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy) and handling Excel files. - Experience in developing simple GUIs, potentially using libraries like Tkinter or Flask for a -based solution. - Understanding of inventory management principles and retail operations. - Ability to deliver clean, well-documented code for maintainability. Conclusion: This project offers an exciting opportunity to impact the operational efficiency of a growing health food retail chain. We're looking for a developer who can deliver a focused solution that aligns with our goals for inventory optimization. If you have the skills and are interested in contributing to this venture, we'd love to hear your proposal, including your approach and any previous experience with similar projects."

AI Image Generator,"['AI Model Integration', 'OpenAI API', 'Python', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Make.com', 'AI Agent Development']",$500.00,"Creating an application that generates consistent character images across multiple scenes based on textual descriptions is a complex but exciting project. Below is a detailed scope of work that outlines the processes, steps, and tools best suited for each section of the project. ### Project Overview: This application allows users to input descriptions of multiple characters and up to 10 scenes, then automatically generates images that visually represent these scenes with the characters consistently portrayed across them. This process involves natural language processing (NLP), image generation, image analysis, and user interaction to ensure character consistency and align with user expectations. ### Tools and Technologies: - **Bubble.io**: A no-code platform for building applications, including user interfaces and simple back-end logic. - **Make.com (formerly Integromat)**: A no-code tool that automates workflows between apps and services without writing code. - **OpenAI's DALL-E**: An AI model capable of generating images from textual descriptions. - **Google Cloud Vision API**: An image analysis tool that can identify and extract features from images. ### Scope of Work: #### 1. Project Setup and Planning - Define project requirements, timelines, and milestones. - Select and set up the necessary tools and accounts (Bubble.io, Make.com, OpenAI API access, Google Cloud account for Vision API). #### 2. User Interface Development with Bubble.io - **User Input Forms**: Design and implement forms for users to input character and scene descriptions. - **Image Review and Approval Interface**: Create interfaces for users to review, approve, or request modifications to generated images. - **User Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement forms or interfaces for users to provide feedback on the application and reported inconsistencies. #### 3. Workflow Automation with Make.com - **Integrate Bubble.io with Image Generation and Analysis APIs**: Set up workflows in Make.com to trigger image generation with DALL-E based on user inputs from Bubble.io, and subsequently, image analysis with Google Cloud Vision API on the generated images. - **Automate Feedback Loops**: Design workflows to handle user requests for modifications, including re-generating images and updating character tagging schemas. #### 4. Character Description Processing and Initial Image Generation - **NLP Processing of Descriptions**: Utilize OpenAI's GPT (or similar NLP models) to parse and standardize character and scene descriptions. This step may require custom coding or integration with an NLP service. - **Generate Initial Character Images**: Use DALL-E to generate initial images based on processed descriptions. Each character is generated separately for user approval. #### 5. Image Analysis for Tagging Schema Creation - **Analyze Approved Images**: Once a character image is approved by the user, use Google Cloud Vision API to analyze the image and extract features to create a standardized tagging schema. - **Store Tagging Schemas**: Develop a system within Bubble.io's database to store and manage the generated tagging schemas for each character. #### 6. Consistent Scene Image Generation - **Generate Scene Images**: Using the stored tagging schemas, generate images for each described scene, incorporating the characters with their consistent features. This involves complex integration between the tagging schemas, scene descriptions, and DALL-E's capabilities. - **User Review and Final Approval**: Present the generated scene images to the user for review and final approval, allowing for further adjustments if necessary. #### 7. Testing, Feedback, and Iteration - **User Testing**: Conduct thorough user testing to identify usability issues, bugs, and areas for improvement. - **Collect and Implement Feedback**: Use user feedback to refine the UI, improve the consistency of image generation, and streamline the overall process. - **Iterate Based on Testing**: Continuously iterate on the application based on testing outcomes and user feedback. #### 8. Deployment and Maintenance - **Deploy the Application**: Make the application available to users, ensuring it is hosted on a reliable platform. - **Set Up Monitoring and Support**: Implement monitoring for application performance and establish a support system for user issues and inquiries. ### Recommended Best Practices: - **Privacy and Security**: Ensure robust privacy and security measures are in place, especially for user data and generated content. - **Scalability**: Design the system with scalability in mind, considering potential future growth in user base and processing demands. - **User-Centric Design**: Keep the user experience at the forefront of design and development, ensuring the application is intuitive and meets user needs."

Our island company is unique, as we provided agriculture services to the local community through the protecting and propagation of local indigenous Hawaiian plant and tree species on the island of Maui, HI. We do this by fostering awareness around the importance of human dependencies on the natural local habitat, cultural awareness and sensitivity based on Hawaiian core values. Together with conservation of Maui‚Äôs ecosystems within these natural systems through a holistic operational process that results in the planting and protection of local plant and tree life. 2.

The Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan is a blueprint for Hawai'i's preferred future. It is the most comprehensive planning process since the Hawai'i State Plan was developed over three decades ago. This plan reflects the hopes and aspirations of Hawai'i's people. And is the guiding light of Maui Built Strong. This represents the heart and soul of our islands (See here, https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/committeefiles/special/COV/Document/Hawaii%20Sustainability%20Task%20Force/04-06-20%20Hawaii%202050%20Plan%20FINAL.pdf).

This not only affects the download and rendering times, contributing further to our LCP issues, but also indicates a broader concern with resource optimization across our site. Moreover, our current speed index of 1.6 seconds on desktop and 8.6s on mobile indicates a slower visual load time than desired, suggesting that the content visibility during page loads is not meeting optimal performance standards. Another critical issue is the loading of unused CSS and JavaScript code. Our site is burdened with unnecessary resources that are not utilized in the rendered pages, with failing Core Vitals Assessment thereby elongating load times unnecessarily and impeding our overall performance metrics. This has led to a less than satisfactory performance profile that requires immediate and comprehensive action to rectify. Task Description We are seeking an experienced WordPress Website Speed Optimization Expert to help with our website. Our goal is to significantly improve our website's performance metrics as highlighted by Google's PageSpeed Insights, specifically focusing on First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Time to First Byte (TTFB), Speed Index and overall website performance. Additionally, we aim to optimize our use of CloudFront for caching, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the WP Rocket plugin. Our current PageSpeed Insights scores are unsatisfactory on both mobile and desktop, with Core Vitals Assessment failing on both platforms. Check it here - https://pagespeed..dev/analysis/http-www-societ-com/pak5r9pt0l?form_factor=desktop. We need someone who can swiftly and efficiently address these issues, enhancing our website‚Äôs loading speed and user experience. We want you to: - Conduct a comprehensive analysis of our website's performance using Google Pagespeed Insights and other relevant tools. - Develop and help execute a detailed optimization strategy focusing on improving FCP, LCP, TTFB, and overall website performance on both desktop and mobile as recommended by Pagespeed Insights. - Configure and optimize Amazon CloudFront distribution for effective caching, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance with the WP Rocket plugin. - Implement best practices for performance optimization, including but not limited to, image optimization, code minification, and lazy loading. - Troubleshoot and help resolve any issues related to website speed, performance, and caching. - Provide detailed guide that can be reused when necessary and documentation on optimization strategies implemented, including before-and-after performance analysis. By March 28th, website performance should be improved - page speed index on both mobile and desktop to 1.0s or less. Also, we want to see our FCP and LCP metric at 2.0s or less on both mobile and desktop."

If the test is successful, it will be built into an actual user friendly tool, but for now it would be fine just to have a very simple interface hosted locally or whatever is easiest. Simple description of what is needed: basically, when it comes to ""cold email outreach"" (do research on what this is if you dont know anything about it), personalisation is key. And I would like to have a tool built which allows me take a CSV full of leads and then the tool takes each lead (lets say we have given NAME, LINKEDIN and WEBSITE) and does a "" search"" on them, like you can do with gpt-4, and collects as much information about that person through that search as possible. It then takes that information and makes a high personalised outreach email tailored to them. This of course has to work very efficiently and on scale, so that has to be considered aswell. If you think you could be a fit / have the expertise to take this on, please let me know and we can get talking. Not searching for some cheap freelancer, im searching for a creative developer with ambition who is willing to grow and learn alongside the team which will eventually be built around this tool in the long term."

Refund Policy: Notify users via SMS and process refunds within 24 hours if they fail to purchase tickets, increasing user trust. 6. Admin Features: In admin mode, be able to delete customer account, password, ID, IP information, and analyze the success rate of ticket purchases for optimizing website operations. Backend Script: 1. Client Request Collection and Cloud Service Horizontal Scalability: Ensure the script effectively collects client requests and supports running on multiple Alibaba Cloud servers simultaneously for horizontal scalability. 2.

"Designer for a WordPress responsive website who thinks ""outside the box""","['Custom Web Design', 'Web Design', 'WordPress', 'Graphic Design']",$500.00,"We are looking to revamp our old and outdated website and build a new, modern one in its place. We are looking for a talented web designer who is proficient in designing unique, responsive WordPress websites that go beyond the usual templates. The website needs to be modern and meet at least some of the trends of 2024, like for example the ones shown in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpIVGR6-EZ4&t=41s Since the website includes a large amount of content and systems, we have our own developer who will handle the construction itself. We are looking for a talented designer (the most important thing in building a new website...) who will build the homepage and 3 versions of internal pages. Since the design needs to include dynamic elements, the designer will need to build the homepage himself. The website itself deals with sailing lessons for speed boats and jet skis, so the field is very dynamic and interesting to design. The website itself is not written in English, but the homepage and 3 internal pages can be designed in English and we will then translate the language. If you are interested in this and you think you can design a ""out of the box"" website, I would be happy if you would contact me for more information. Thank you!"

AutoHotKey AHK Macro Script - Azure Virtual Machine - RDP Remote Server Control (via API),"['Macro Programming', 'Microsoft Windows PowerShell', 'AutoHotKey', 'Windows Server', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Scripting', '', '', '+2']",$500.00,"I have an Azure VM running Windows 11. I want to run pre-scripted actions/programs on there remotely, from my Python Server. BASIC IDEA ### First, I want to ""record"" a task or action I want to take. This could involve either a Windows program and/or the web browser. The task will involve both the mouse cursor and keyboard in most cases. This would ideally be done by ""recording"" a VM session. I want to be able to record a few different actions like this, and then trigger them via my Python server (I already have the server setup, but we are running into problems on the VM side of things). So the process to record scripts will be... 1. I somehow record an action I want to take (browse website, use program), eg with Autohotkey 2. I save this as some type of file (eg ahk) or script Then, when I want to run this script... 3. My Python server makes an API call to the VM RDP remote session - eg. run ""make-image-with-gimp.ahk"" or ""go-to-midjourney-com-with-chrome.ahk"" 4. The script runs and does its thing 5. I repeat with new scripts as needed (obviously there may be logic issues here that may cause errors with the macros/scripts, but right now we haven't even got to that point). AUTOHOTKEY ### My initial idea was to use Autohotkey, and have .ahk macros triggered. The python script runs RDP and then tries to trigger the .ahk file. However, we are running into various issues when triggering the macros (see attached for exact error). I therefore need a way to get such scripts running, so my Python server can trigger them remotely. See attached for the progress my dev has made so far, and errors we've encountered. I do not know if autohotkey is the only solution - or if it is possible to use other methods like PowerShell Remoting or Selenium WebDriver. PLEASE NOW RESPOND ### Please respond with: a) how you would accomplish this b) whether you can fix the .ahk issue or intend to take a different approach c) whether you are looking to automate Windows programs actions, browsing actions or both Thanks!"

Integrating Bkav eHoadon with ERPNext for e-invoice management in Vietnam,"['Web Development', 'Python', 'ERPNext', 'API', 'SOAP API', 'SOAP']","$1,000.00","1. Understand Bkav Webservice Connection Model From the documentation provided, Bkav eHoadon offers a SOAP web service for various operations related to e-invoices, such as creating, updating, checking status, and more. Key points include: SOAP Protocol: Bkav uses SOAP for its service, so the integration will need to handle SOAP requests and responses. Authentication: Authentication is done using a PartnerGUID and PartnerToken provided by Bkav. Data Encryption: Requests to Bkav must be encrypted using AES-256 with the provided PartnerToken. Command Types: Different operations (e.g., creating invoices, updating details, checking status) are identified by specific CmdType codes. 2. ERPNext Setup and Customization Custom Fields: Depending on the integration requirements, you may need to add custom fields to ERPNext's Sales Invoice doctype (or others) to store additional data required by Bkav, such as PartnerInvoiceID, InvoiceGUID, and Look-up code. Custom Scripts: Develop custom scripts in ERPNext to handle the generation and encryption of SOAP requests based on ERPNext's invoice data, and to parse the responses from Bkav. Workflow Customization: Customize the invoice workflow in ERPNext to include steps for sending invoices to Bkav for e-invoice generation and for updating the invoice status based on Bkav's responses. 3. Integration Development SOAP Client: Implement a SOAP client in Python (or another language that ERPNext supports) to handle communication with Bkav's service. Python libraries like zeep can be used to work with SOAP services. Encryption: Implement AES-256 encryption for the request data using Python's cryptography library, following Bkav's specifications. Data Mapping: Map ERPNext invoice data to the required format for Bkav's service. This includes converting data to JSON/XML, encrypting it, and wrapping it in a SOAP request. Response Handling: Parse the encrypted responses from Bkav, decrypt them, and update the corresponding invoices in ERPNext based on the response data. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage any issues that arise during the communication with Bkav's service. 4. Testing and Deployment Use Bkav eHoadon Demo: Initially, use Bkav's demo system for testing to ensure that the integration works as expected without affecting live data. Testing: Conduct thorough testing to cover all scenarios, including invoice creation, updates, status checks, and error handling. Deployment: Once testing is successful, deploy the integration to the live environment, switch to the live URLs of Bkav's service, and monitor the integration closely for any issues. 5. Documentation and Training Documentation: Document the integration process, including the setup steps, customizations made in ERPNext, and how to use the integration. Training: Train the end-users on how to manage e-invoices within ERPNext, including any new steps introduced by the integration."

Exhibited Ars Eletronica'23 (Linz, Austria) and Transmediale'24 (Berlin, Germany), the immersive installation with chatbot app will now be on show at IMPAKT from 22.3.2024 to 19.5.2024 and then at a biennial in northern Italy and urgently needs a few updates. Problem A: Google recently did their own update for Dialogflow, which we postponed because it was unclear if the plug-ins would continue to work with the interface or if code needs to be updated at the same time. Since then, the matching of questions and answers in Dialogflow has worked less well than before. Going forward, we would have the update by Google done and the developer will take care of the functionality of the plug-ins so that the interface app interacts with Dialogflow seemlessly. Problem B: That would be working on the Dialogflow content library and optimizing it. At the moment I'm using the free Essential version of DialogFlow, but you could upgrade to the Professional version. According to Google's customer service, this would result in optimization options for conversations as well as other import paths for questions and answers, e.g. the import of entire eBooks. Up to now, the entries (training phrases, responses) of the deterministic bot have been entered individually and there are more than 10,000 of them - it is referred to as a professional chatbot. Do you have time and want to help me? if you can only solve one problem, please let me know. Most is important is problem A. If you want to see the code I have a copy in Github which I can share with you for review purpose. Please apply with your skill level, other apps you have developed, basic CV specs, and references. Ideally would be if we could contact one of your clients to give a reference via the phone or Zoom call. THANK YOU!"

One is a chrome extension and the other is a app. This is a app that takes a csv and does 3 things, cleans the csv, extracts data from it and uses an API to a PDF generator that returns this PDF as a media. I am a ML engineer so I did all of the data science part, I have the functions that clean the csv, extract data from it and the code that does a POST request to the API builder.

Then once this is Confirmed then we show them the clean CSV with our columns headers names and their columns data, we technically drop the uncleaned csv but you don‚Äôt have to worry about this because I built the code that does this so for you, you send a csv with mapping dictionary and you receive the cleaned csv and you have to display it, then they click on continue and it shows them COMP Data, this data has comes in form of a dictionary that also you don‚Äôt have to worry about because I built this as well.

Full Website App Development using Raw PHP,"['Web Development', 'PHP', 'JavaScript', 'MySQL', 'HTML']",$200.00,"current site is: mktbanter.com We are looking for a skilled developer to help us build features to a full website app using raw PHP. The app is currently functional with clean organized code in raw php. The app looks and feels a lot like twitter as is. we are trying to implement functions similar to the website stocktwits.com. Here are the new features I'd like to add: 1.) Cashtag function: A functionality to convert the current hashtags into cashtags. For example, if a user types a dollar sign followed by a company's stock ticker symbol (eg., $AAPL), the system would recognize this as a cashtag related to Apple Inc.

Cashtag-based chat streams: When a user clicks on a cashtag, they should be directed to a separate chat stream relating to that specific stock. StockTwits.com does this well; please use that as an example of what I mean. 3.) Stock Chart Integration: For each cashtag chat stream, there needs to be a feature where a mini stock chart for that particular company's stock is displayed. The chart would provide basic details like current price, trading volume, and historical prices. StockTwits.com does this well; please use that as an example of what I mean. This is a great opportunity to showcase your expertise in PHP development and create a high-quality, custom website app. The ideal candidate should have a strong understanding of PHP and be able to handle complex coding tasks.

Music service website development,"['Web Development', 'Web Design', 'JavaScript', 'Graphic Design', 'CSS', 'WordPress', 'API']","$1,000.00","Seeking a committed, long-term partnership with an experienced full-stack developer proficient in APIs and website development, particularly with expertise in implementing automatic monthly payment functionalities. It's essential that you are genuinely interested in the niche website's development beyond financial gains. The website's services revolve around utilizing the Spotify API and related aspects of the music industry, aiming to assist artists and playlist curators in expanding their audience and listenership on Spotify. The initial task involves creating the HOME page, serving as the primary landing page, presenting comprehensive information about the service, its functionalities, and pricing details. The top navigation bar features the service logo on the left and a ""Connect with Spotify"" button on the right. 1. Integration with Spotify API to connect user profiles. 2. Once connected, the page dynamically showcases profile statistics in the central content area, activating the ""Dashboard"" section in the navigation bar. Additional navigation options include ""Upgrade My Plan,"" ""Track Trade In Playlist,"" ""Grow My Playlist,"" ""Listen and Earn Free Credits"" and ""My Campaigns,"" along with a button indicating the available credit amount that after pressing button directs user to ""Upgrade My Plan"" page. All website functions are contingent upon the credit balance. Users receive two free credits daily upon logging in. ""Upgrade My Plan"" directs users to a page displaying pricing options and their current plan status. Initially, users are on the Free plan with 50 credits available. The page also indicates the duration until the next payment for premium plans, highlighting the remaining days and additional credit balance. A small ""Cancel Subscription"" button is available for premium plans. ""Track Trade In Playlist"" is where you can trade tracks from your playlists. First, website check if your playlists are real using another website's tool (API). Then, we display your verified playlists and playlist followers. Once you pick a track, you have to select one of the genres fom dropdown list for your playlist. Then website start a trade campaign, showing your playlist and the song you want to swap to other users who also entered this campaign. You can easily browse through different playlist genres and follower counts to find suitable playlist track trade user. To submit your offer to other user, you need to use your own credits earned on website. The number of credits you will need to spend depends on the difference in followers and estimated streams between the playlists + additional credit goes to website holder that is the fee for contacting other profile for this offer. After you send credits to other user and website holder, webesite notifies the other user with details of your offer, prefered also through email. They can accept or reject it. If they accept, both songs are added to each other's playlists, and you get the credits offered. If they decline, you get your credits back, but not the credits spent for website service. ""Boost My Playlist"" lets you promote your playlist. Pick a playlist you want to share (similar to starting set up of ""Track Trade In Playlist"" where another website's tool (API) checks playlist and user have to select genre of playlist), and it will appear in the ""Power Hour"" section of other users' profiles. ""Power Hour"" is a sub page where all acivity is happening - Users listen to your playlist, and for each song they listen to, they earn credits. The more they listen, the more credits they get. To join the ""Power Hour,"" users need to spend some credits, but they get them back after listening for an hour. The idea is simple: listen to others' playlists, and they'll listen to yours, helping everyone grow their playlists together. User is not able to pick playlist he wants to listen - playlist appears on screen depending on demand from other user listening activity. Only thing that user can do is selecting genre of playlist he want to listen. ""Track Campaign"" functions similarly to ""Grow My Playlist,"" but users promote specific Spotify tracks by entering their links, which also incur a ""Power Hour"" entrance fee. ""Listen and Earn Free Credits"" displays submitted other website user tracks from ""Grow My Playlist"" and ""Track Campaign,"" allowing users to earn credits by listening. Users can listen up to 10 tracks every 12 hours, each granting two additional free credits. ""My Campaigns"" provides an overview of ongoing activities, including notifications for track trade offers, progress in playlist growth campaigns, and track promotion campaigns. If you're interested, feel free to get in touch with me. I'm not a developer or programmer myself, so you can use any coding language you prefer for these tasks. I can provide you with some layout templates from other sites that share similarities with certain features of this project."

Starshippit Intergration with Ruby on Rails,"['Web Development', 'Ruby on Rails', 'API']","$1,000.00","We are seeking a skilled Ruby on Rails developer to create a custom interface for our Shopify store's shipping label printing process using the Starshipit API. The ideal candidate should have experience working with APIs, version control systems, and be familiar with modern development platforms like Replit. Project Overview: Our company currently uses Starshipit to print shipping labels for orders placed on our Shopify store. We want to develop a custom interface using Ruby on Rails to streamline our shipping process and add custom functionality. Key Features: 1. Barcode scanning: Implement a search field that allows users to scan an order number using a barcode scanner connected to their computer. The system should then display the corresponding order details. 2. Shipping method buttons: Display multiple buttons on the interface, each representing a different shipping method. These buttons will trigger different POST requests to the Starshipit API based on the selected shipping method. 3. Label printing: After selecting the shipping method, the system should send the appropriate request to the Starshipit API and initiate the label printing process. Technical Requirements: 1. Use Ruby on Rails to develop the application, leveraging its MVC architecture and RESTful conventions. 2. Integrate with the Starshipit API to fetch order data and send shipping label printing requests. 3. Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage the codebase and enable easy collaboration and change management. 4. Consider using modern development platforms like Replit to facilitate collaboration and streamline the development process. Workflow: 1. User scans the order barcode using a barcode scanner connected to their computer. 2. The system retrieves the order details from the Starshipit API and displays them on the interface. 3. User selects the appropriate shipping method by pressing a corresponding key on the keyboard. 4. The system sends a POST request to the Starshipit API with the necessary shipping details. 5. The system waits for the label to be printed and then returns to the scanning step for the next order. If you are interested please let me know your interest and don't use AI to apply. Below give you a rough idea. https://api-docs.starshipit.com/ Based on the Starshipit API documentation and support articles, here are the key steps to implement your desired workflow: 1. When you fetch the unfulfilled orders from Shopify via the Starshipit API, store the order details including the order number in your local database. 2. In your interface, set up the barcode scanning functionality to look up orders by their order number. When an order is found, display its details on the page. 3. Provide buttons or options on the page to select the packaging type and shipping service for that order. For example, have options for Regular vs Express post, and Small/Regular/Large/Extra Large satchel sizes. 4. When one of those packaging/service buttons is clicked: a. Capture the selected packaging type, size, and shipping service. b. Make a POST request to the Starshipit `/labels` endpoint, passing in: - The order number and other required order details - The selected packaging and shipping service details in the `shippingMethod` parameter - Set `updateTracking` to `false` to prevent updating Shopify status c. Starshipit will generate the shipping label and return it in the API response. d. Display or download the label for printing. 5. After successfully generating the label, update the order status to ""printed"" in your local database. Do not update Shopify yet. 6. Later, when you are ready to mark the orders as fulfilled in Shopify: a. Display the list of ""printed"" orders in your interface. b. Provide a button to trigger the tracking update for selected orders. c. When clicked, make a POST request to the Starshipit `/tracking` endpoint: - Pass in the order number and tracking details - Set `updateTracking` to `true` d. Starshipit will send the tracking info to Shopify and mark the order as fulfilled. The key points are: - Use the `/labels` endpoint to generate labels, specifying the packaging and shipping service in the `shippingMethod` parameter. Set `updateTracking` false. - Use the `/tracking` endpoint as a separate later step to update tracking in Shopify. Set `updateTracking` true. - Store order and tracking status locally in your own database to decouple label printing from Shopify fulfillment. So in summary, the Starshipit API provides the necessary endpoints to implement your desired workflow. You can control the label generation and Shopify tracking update as separate steps by leveraging the `updateTracking` flag and managing order state in your local database."

"Wordpress and Woocommerce php,css and javascript changes needed.","['Web Development', 'WordPress', 'JavaScript', 'PHP', 'CSS 3', 'WooCommerce', 'HTML5']",$280.00,"I have a website with wordpress. The plugins that i use are Woocommerce, Food-Store and Notify Telegram. When a client place an order i get the order on Telegram. What needs to be changed: 1) a) I have a Menu on top (Slider) with food categories and when i select one category for example Burgers i want to see only the Burgers. Not the rest. https://i.postimg.cc/VsHvsz80/1-slider-menu-click.png b) The Menu (Slider) has an icon on the left and the Title on the right. I would like the icon to be on top of the Title. https://i.postimg.cc/DfDCrbhv/menub.png Titles and Icons should be visible when they are selected or not. (Example not Black background Gray letters etc etc.) c) On the same Menu (Slider) i would like an indicator (arrow?) so it will be visible that it has more categories and can scroll left/right. https://i.postimg.cc/VsHvsz80/1-slider-menu-click.png check number 3 (arrow). 2) a) I would like at the Bottom (Cart icon) to be automatically updated if a user add a product. For example 1,2,3. b) Move icon on bottom cart to the left side because the basket is barely visible on my phone. https://i.postimg.cc/8cvNpJM1/cart2.png 3) a) When i go to woocommerce to products and i add an attribute (Name) i want that Name to be displayed on product page. Right now if i add 2 attributes for example Size/Color i will get this: Small Medium Large Blue Red Black What i want is this: Size: Small Medium Large Color: Blue Red Black https://i.postimg.cc/CKvqDttR/3a.png 4) I would like to add 3 Tips buttons on checkout page. For example 0.50 Euro, 1 Euro , 2 Euro and under those buttons i would like a user input box that he will be able to add any amount and on the right of this box a button named Add Tip. This will also need to be displayed in telegram. https://i.postimg.cc/vHhyhsYH/4.png 5) Remove price from woocommerce addons when price = 0 from pages like Product page,Cart,Checkout not sure if it is displayed anywhere else. https://i.postimg.cc/fTNXXxyQ/5.png 6) I have an order history page based on cookie/session (as a guest) that keeps previous orders and i would like to add a button (Order Again) so the client will be able to re-order. https://i.postimg.cc/tTX6w6ZV/6.jpg 7) I would like when a user adds a special note on a product and complete the order to receive this special note also on telegram. https://i.postimg.cc/Sj01WVRM/7.png 8) I would like to add a back to previous page indicator (Like an arrow) on 3 pages (History order,My order,Checkout Page). https://i.postimg.cc/bwYYbRtM/8.png 9) When a user scan a QR Code he is redirected to the link: https://site.com/?table=yellow&tid=12 the link is using the table and id parameters. I would like to change that link to something like: https://example.com/?table=00ca517436c0f49ec3bc75faf798df340bf7b457be7e1bddcf4ac6ebc00a64b2&tid=IwAR2Sm4VBra3kCnUQeZL77Mi8avZvd8RgYSTR4AL6DXn8GrEZw0dQmYPZf0Y and match that random values to tables and tids so i will get to my telegram something like Table Yellow, Id 12 but the user will not be able to see it. The main goal is for the user not to be able to mess with the system. Now he can understand the logic with table=yellow and tid=12 so he can add like table=yellow and tid=11 and order for a different table. Any big random numbers and letters are fine. Not sure if encryption helps on that case. You can recommend me what you think is better. 10) I would like if it is possible to rename the Plugin Food-Store folder name on my server. 11) I would like to add on the main menu page a button named Request Assistance that when a user press it will display under it a short message like: Are you sure you need Assistance? With 2 options as a button Yes/No. When the client clicks Yes the main button Title should change from Request Assistance to Please Wait and i will get notified on telegram (with buttons like Processing and Completed) When i press Processing the client will be able to see that i am processing his request by changing the Please Wait to Processing. When i click Completed the button title will change back to Request Assistance. If the client clicks No the short description and the buttons Yes/No should disappear. User should not be able to press the Request Assistance button again if his request is not Completed. if non of this buttons (processing/completed) is pressed i want to get notified again after 5 min with a message on telegram. 12) The menu icon right now is on header on the left and needs to be moved to the middle and the drop down menu to be centered too. Of course i will provide access to the server and the needed screenshots to explain its task. If you have any question ask me and will provide more info. I think that the needed skills for this project are php,css and javascript. If you think that there is a better way to implement the above just let me know. If you think that you can't complete 1 or 2 or more tasks from the list please let me know which ones."

ADD TO CART BUTTON (we don't want that) it should SAY BOOK NOW and at this point there should be a link to our CALENDAR for guest to select available dates (we don't have that option now) so when guests attemp to make a reservation after selecting BOOK NOW they're automatical sent to the CALENDAR available dates for selection. 2. QUANTITY (we don't want that) it should SAY Nights so when viewing the reservation summary it indicates total number of nights and not QUANTITY. 3.

Only detailed personalized applications will be considered (copy-paste generic applications will be ignored) We are eager to expand our development team, looking for a highly skilled senior developer or dev team, ready to take over most of the development process. This is a high initial risk, high lifelong reward job and needs to be treated as an investment. If you are looking for a fixed pay, this job will not be for you. I am looking for a partner, not an employee. If you are smart, looking for financial independence and believe in your own forces, I will be glad to talk with you. This project is funded by myself so I will never ask you to invest money as well. What I need from you is your trust, your belief in this project, your time, dedication and skills. What's so special and why it would work? My project is based on 4 years of planning, thousands of feedback from buyers and sellers demanding what we are now building. It brings lots of solutions to existing problems left unsolved by the existing local marketplaces. Part of the project is already built, we have a team of developers, a highly skilled CTO, designs, technical documentations and a consultant team for the opening. It's a very scallable project, expected to grow quickly as the market demands for our solutions. Domains were bought in the most important economic countries in Europe and the platform will first be tested and expanded on the Swiss Market before going global. Very important: I am aware that even on Upwork, there are people attempting shady stuff. I want to let you know that I am not here for that, I am not here to scam you, take advantage of you or neglect you. If you contribute to this project, you will be like my family and I have always taken care of my family first. Your reward will be prioritized before mine and your ideas will always be listened to. This will be your project as well. No corporate BS! Short details: - Looking for: Senior Developer or a dev team (long-term only) - Starting: Immediatelly - Project: Swiss C2C Marketplace - Progress: ~40% already completed - Team: CTO & Upwork dev team from India including BA, QA, Dev, DevOps, working on the project via Upwork since February 2023 - Tech Stack: React & NodeJS - Preferable release of the first draft: August 2024 - Projected go live date: end of 2024 - Pay: Your contribution could easily reach a reward of 1 mil. Swiss Francs in the first year. It will be paid in monthly dividents, from the net generated profit (up to 25% monthly net profit, up to 1mil/year). - Your dedication, cooperation, skills and ingenuity will play a decisive role in your recompense. This means, the more you contribute and push the project forward, the more you will earn. When the 1mil marker has been achieved, we will discuss about either a fixed salary, profit share or a combination of both. Part of the payment will be via Upwork as well. - Competition: Minimum estimated NET profit per user is 1$/month. The current competition has 4 million users and we are planning to be better, smarter, fairer and provide protectin against fraud/ scams. - Why it can't fail? There is no other competition apart from one single running platform, slowly losing interest from people. Most users no longer using that platform, will come to ours, while the existing users will have all the motivation to post their items on ours, to gain more visibility as well as benefit from all our aditional features. I actively buy and sell on the Swiss marketplace and have gained many contacts, who cannot wait to jump on our platform. These clients actively sell hundreds or thousands of items every month. Initial conversations with major shops resulted in a positive potential implication as well. - Your general tasks: You will be the coding mastermind of the project, working side by side with our existing development team. Together with our CTO, you will debate ideas, find solutions, create user stories and build an innovative structure for the features to come, as well as for the whole project. - What you must have: Time, Will power, resillience, great communication skills and a stable income/ enough side money to cover for yourself till the project is launched and profitable. Plus points for leadership experience and/ or experience on working on marketplaces. - Your potential scenario after the first year on the project: Financial independence, possibility to relocate to Switzerland, flexible stress-free work in a growing stable environment"

If you prefer, we can also consider using WordPress, depending on what's easier for you. The budget is tight, so I'll need you to do that in the simplest and fastest way since this is a MVP (minimum viable product). The main task is to create the store, which should be pretty straightforward. The interesting part is the user profile page. On this page, I want to create something like a digital sticker album. Imagine you have a bunch of stickers representing different products, and when you collect them, they combine to form a complete picture. For example, if you collect all the dinner table items like plates, candles, and flowerpots, they would form a complete dinner table image. The album will show these stickers stacked on top of each other, kind of like a 3D view. Each sticker represents a different product type. If a buyer doesn't have a particular product yet, the sticker will appear in light gray to show it's missing. When the buyer hovers over a gray sticker, a little message will pop up saying they don't have that product yet. They'll have two buttons: one to search for the product and another to add it to their wish list (yes, we'll need to create a wish list feature). Once a buyer purchases a product corresponding to a grayed-out sticker, the sticker will darken to show they've bought it. Also, hovering over the sticker will show a short description of the product, and clicking it will take them to the product page in a new tab. The design and actions should be clean and easy to understand. Additionally, we'll need two lists: a wish list and a list of items the buyer already has, so they can keep track of what they want and what they've already got. Lastly, we'll include a notification feature to alert buyers when an item on their list goes on sale. If possible, we'll also add an option to automatically create promotions for items on their wish list."

Amazon Scraping API powered by Django & Pytho Incomplete Developer Left,"['Amazon Web Services', 'Python', 'API', 'Data Scraping', 'API Development']","$1,500.00","Hi, Last year a project we were building was halted by a developer who decided to leave the project over half way through. I spent a lot of money building a project to have it unfortunately ripped away. I spent ¬£1000 a month on ads built up a waiting list of hundreds of potential clients. For him to one day just cancel the project out of know where and run. I dont know the state of the project I dont know how many APIs are completed what needs work etc. Front end was designed I believe. I have some files & I have AWS logins & I think we have some scraping proxy login too. I'll start by saying I'm not interested in starting again we have no budget for it. But we're hoping someone can complete this and expect payment after launch. So we will have 3 phases 1. Development 2. Beta testing for couple weeks 3. Launch - On launch we will pay you the owed amount & you have to be available for a monthly based contract to maintain and deal with emergency outages. I think the completed APIs were the following: FBA Fee API, Product Data API, Search API & the Variations API  I'M going to attach messages from the previous developer so you can see the updates he gave me. I believe he got stuck on the offers api and this is where things started going wrong. ------------ I have the front end & backend files. But I wont relase this stuff until I find the right match for the project and NDAs are signed. Frontend is ready, I'll share the zip file for the frontend which you can attach, apart from that, backend was started in python django which has the complete backend for ""API Gateway"" page, Although that still needs more features. Apart from that the whole backend is required for the frontend including the authentication, payment gateway etc. Database: DynamoDB Authentication: Firebase API Hosting: Lambda API Authentication: AWS API Gateway Payment Gateway: Stripe Backend: Django & Python Frontend: React JS, HTML, CSS, TAILWIND, WordPress. VPS Hosting: TBD You will have to have extensive knowledge of AWS & Scraping for this project. ALL AI & COPY PASTE ALICATIONS WILL BE DELETED. I DONT BOTHER READING THEM.

"Clean up CSS, Javascript, HTML","['CSS', 'HTML', 'JavaScript', 'Website']",$100.00,"Web server functionality has been added to a music management system (developed in Qt/C++). While the actual Qt/C++ front end is used for managing the data, the web front end has been developed to (read-only) query and also start & stop playing music. Basic functionality is working on the server side, I need someone to polish this up. I need someone who is comfortable logging into a remote Linux box (using SSH) and: 1. use command line editors (vi, nano or your favorite editor) to edit HTML, CSS and Javascript code. 2. stop and start the music app (which contains the server) after making changes to HTML, CSS or Javascript code. At this point I'd like to stick to these technologies, so I am not looking for recommandations on other frameworks (like J-query et al). Some of the problems that need to be fixed: - large amount of header space - migrate to use DIV's instead of HTML tables - inconsistent formatting between line items - when selecting another (alphabet) letter, page should scroll to the front - implementing explode/implode buttons at header levels for each page - there are probably more little cosmetical bugs. Some of the HTML files contain primitives (e.g. ___SB_PERFORMERS___). These primitives are expanded into HTML code (that includes CSS and Javascript references) within the Qt/C++ app. I can change this output on request when necessary. Bonus points if you know how to compile Qt/C++ in Linux so that you don't have to use the remote login. However, spending time on compiling the source and getting this up and running is *NOT* part of the contract. Contract time starts when actual editing of HTML, CSS and/or Javascript code takes place."

From there, they can provide feedback on one or more items. These screens serve to illustrate the survey flow. We're seeking the expertise of a UX Designer to greatly improve the flow and design of these screens.

The overall design should be easy to understand and navigate for all users, regardless of their level of tech-savviness. Please share your ideas or similar work you have done. We want to screen before engaging for the actual work. Here are a few important considerations: 1. Users have limited attention spans, so the goal is to minimize the number of clicks needed to gather information. Users may not want to spend more than 30 to 45 seconds per item. 2. Typically, users may select 3 to 4 items, but occasionally they may choose up to 7 items. 3. The application is -based and optimized for mobile phones. Users are not required to download an app to provide feedback, and the interface should be compatible with all mobile devices. 4. We want to allow submittion of the survey per item. So, we capture survey for for atleast a few items, in scenarios user abandons the survey before finishing up on all items. 5. We prefer to use React.js with Bootstrap for developing this application. So, the artifacts shared at the end of the work, should be easily usable for the final implementation. Screen Descriptions to Illustrate Desired Functionality. Please note that these are solely for outlining the flow. Feel free to reimagine the flow and associated screens. Screen 1: The landing page where users choose the items for feedback. Users can select one or more items, typically 3 or 4, with a maximum of 7. Upon loading, all menu items are fetched from the backend and displayed. As users type in the selection textbox, matching items (up to 10) appear for selection. After making their choices, users can click submit. Upon submission, a call is made to the backend to retrieve survey questions for the selected items. The questions are stored in memory and presented to users one item at a time, leading to Screen 2 and Screen 3, which repeat for each food item. Screen 2: Offers an overview of feedback categories‚ÄîFlavor, Texture, Freshness, and Presentation. Users provide ratings here. Based on their ratings, Screen 3 presents specific questions for those categories. Screen 3: Delivers detailed questions based on Screen 2 ratings. For instance, if a user rated Flavor poorly, specific questions about the flavor are presented. Users can select detailed options for each category and provide additional comments. After completion, users can submit the survey/feedback, which is then saved in the backend database. This process repeats for each item selected on Screen 1 until feedback is provided for all chosen items."

Build Sign-In With Discord on Wix Studio/Editor X,"['Web Development', 'API', 'Wix', 'Discord', 'Discord Bot Development', 'JavaScript']",$200.00,"I have a successful discord server with over 1500 members. CURRENT PROCESS: - A member completes an 8-step form application on Typeform. - They are redirected to Discord and they join our server with no permissions. - They verify their email inside of the server and get the 'verified' role, in our backend, this links their email to their discord ID. - They wait on our team to approve their application. - Zapier triggers when someone is 'approved' on our backend and then they get the 'approved' role in Discord to access all channels. Then, when they have access to Discord, we give them a link to our online courses. Our online courses are stored on Editor X (soon to be Wix Studio) and we must keep them here. So, to access the materials, we are using Wix members tool as a login. This tool supports Google SSO but not Discord Oauth2. The problem this is causing is that we have to search our database for the person's email address and then manually accept them on Wix if our backend shows that they have the approved role on Discord. ------ What I Want: - The main priority is that I want people to be able to login to our Wix site using Discord Oauth2 and not need to put their email in. - The second thing that would be an added bonus and something I would pay an extra $100 for, is if people could complete 5-steps of the application (the questions that aren't just gathering email and name details) and then it would send them to a Discord Oauth2. Essentially, I am looking for something where we could capture the typeform details and link their discord Oauth2 and email address to store it all at once - this would remove the need for them to verify their email address. ------ HOW TO APPLY: To confirm you have read the requirements, please reply ""BANANAS"" and then explain how you would execute this project.

To find out if you are the right fit, we would like you to recreate one of the most complex pages of the site, which is the individual stock page (e.g. https://www.obermatt.com/en/stocks/ibm-ibm/stock-research.html). This is a template that is used for all of the 6‚Äô500+ stocks we cover. We need a concept that can be further refined, but that can be replicated in HTML and CSS only, without using any frameworks. The website should be viewed similarly on desktop/tablet and mobile. Mobile responsiveness is important. In this phase, we only need desktop and mobile mockups - no coding and detailing needed. A fixed price of $120 is set for this trial run. The deliverables are mockup designs of the desktop and mobile version of this page. Below is more background information about the task at hand and the company: About Obermatt: Obermatt provides private investors with stock analysis for 6,500+ stocks worldwide. Stocks are analyzed from the perspectives of Value, Growth, Safety, Sentiment and a combined 360¬∞ View. We provide free content in German and English to generate free subscribers, primarily in Germany, Switzerland and other markets. Paying subscribers get access to additional analyses, as well as more search and filtering options. The stock analysis is based on ""relative"" performance measurement, which allows us to rank companies on a scale of 1 to 100 against their peers and competitors and present our analysis in a simple, quick and intuitive way, which is specially helpful to non-professional investors. The higher a company's ranking, the ""better"" the company's performance; red is bad and green is good, simple as that. Objective and background information of the stock pages: The objective of this page is to convert website visitors into free or paying subscribers. The page should communicate credibility, trust and still feel accessible to a non-professional retail investor. Our main audience here are potential stock investors who don‚Äôt have a high level of financial expertise and are not very versed in investing. The secondary objective would be for people to spend more time on the site. Crosslinking is important and could be optimized. It seems that currently we have many links that clutter the page and streamlining or optimizing from the point of UX could help us. The look should be professional and knowledgeable and should move away from it looking too technical. People who land on these stock pages, when coming from the search engines, are usually people looking for investing information on the specific company. These pages hold free information publicly available to non-subscribers. More data is available to the paying subscribers in a separate area of the website. There are three main data types shown on the page: - The company information (top area) - The ranks: marked with colors and a 1-100 number; green = good, red = bad - A lot of additional text that further explains how to interpret each rank Every category has several different ranks and a consolidated rank. You can play around with how you display these consolidated ranks and categories. Please feel free not to follow the current layout and set up the page so that it makes sense from a UX point of view: if there is some content that you think would be better hidden / collapsible, feel free to experiment. Also, we are open to seeing a different way to display the ranks. On top of everything, the 360 View is the overall rank that takes into account all other consolidated ranks. We currently don't show the current rank to the free users, but you can add it if you think it would add value to the design concept. If we do, we can show it more prominently. If we don‚Äôt show the 360 content, think of how we can improve the current display in order to optimize it for conversions. The text on the page further explains all the ranks. It is automatically generated and, like ranks, updates each week. Maybe we can display it differently if you think that it makes sense. For SEO and conversion purposes, we would definitely keep the current ranks and the additional text. The historical data could be removed if you think that it would help us in reaching our conversion goals and reducing the clutter. You can also use pop-ups or other features if they make sense. Branding and corporate identity The branding definitions and the logo can be supplied once the job has been awarded. We would stick to the brown and orange (we use the orange for highlighting) and you can make adjustments to other colors as you see fit. Please make sure that the colors used (especially when displaying the data) are accessible to the color blind. You can also suggest fonts that aren‚Äôt mentioned in the guidelines as you see fit for us. Thank you for your consideration. We are looking forward to working with you and to receiving your designs!"

This capability doesn't necessarily need to exist on the mobile apps; Internet browser-only access to account management would be acceptable, although app access would be desirable. This capability could be implemented by integration with an existing service like Stripe, or some other third-party payment processor. 2. An authentication process whereby users are authenticated, based on their subscription status, each time they access the live stream via Internet browser OR by using the station's iOS or Android mobile app. Users should NOT have to log in every time they access the stream, but they should still be authenticated with each session and logged out should their subscription expire. 3. An open stream check to determine how many devices are accessing the stream under the same credentials. For their convenience, users should be allowed to use the service on multiple devices; however, this should be limited to no more than three streams on three different devices at a time, in order to prevent wide sharing of subscriptions. 4. A private portal whereby Administrators would be able to manage subscriptions, grant complimentary access, etc. 5. A mechanism for offering an automatically-expiring ""free trial"" for new subscribers, after which time the would be required to become an authenticated (paid) listener. Administrators should be able to adjust the length and availability of such trials from time to time.

I'm looking to rebuild a website made in Duda in Wordpress. The site in Duda is pretty good right now, so in order for switching to WP to be worth it, the WP site really needs to be great. Sharp design, loading quickly, mobile optimization built in, etc. This website is for a counseling organization. I'll share the URL with you once I receive your proposal so I can get your specific thoughts. GOALS: - Ultimately the rebuild in Wordpress is so we can leverage powerful plugins and tools to move faster and more efficiently in our online marketing goals. - Another goal is to be able to update sections in the site more easily. Global sections for rapid updates sitewide... For example, we have a ""clinicians"" section that I'd like to be able to update as the company adds clinicians, and not have to update each one on each page individually. - We'd also like to polish the design and make the design more consistent and engaging. The site is good now, but it's a bit bland at times. Slightly polished design, including more creative and engaging ways to display content. I would like to do Figma mockups before we actually do any building of course. This is not a rush project or overnight deal. NOTES: - The website will have a very extensive content library, so if you have advice or expertise on structuring things in Wordpress or using certain plugins to make this more effective please mention so. - The website will also have a long list of location pages for the cities they serve. Are there dynamic ways we can pull in data or create location pages more effectively or efficiently? I will be happy to share more of the specific vision for this website once we're talking 1-on-1. For now, please send me your best proposal and give me a reason to get there. Can you build and help manage a website with 100,000's of words of content, many articles, blog posts, pages, and interconnecting systems?

My business supports organisations, including universities, local councils and corporates to support their chosen audience (e.g. staff, students, local residents) to adopt green behaviour changes and reduce carbon emissions while having a positive environmental impact. It does this with a behavioural science backed software tool that supports people to make measurable changes across waste, energy, transport, food and purchasing behaviour. I want to use Webflow for the marketing website to generate leads for this software tool. The key CTA on the website will be to request a demo. I will provide the sitemap and existing mockups (mostly screenshots of existing pages and some wireframes) to shortlisted candidates. I will provide all copy and content for the site. You need to be able to quickly and easily build a series of pages for the website according to the mockups I provide you. Your job will also require you to apply my company's branding and style guide to the webflow site - to ensure consistency across website UI components in line with the style guide. I will also provide you with the visual assets showcasing the software to include on the website. There is also a CMS you will be required to set up for a large series of blog posts and sustainability guides on specific topics that will be offered for free on the website. This will integrate with Airtable as the database for this CMS (I can connect Airtable with Webflow CMS if you aren't familiar with how to do this). You will l need to be confident and experienced in building out webflow CMS pages. You will also be required to include a high quality pop-up form for the website that captures emails from site visitors, ideally one that is set to pop up when the visitor is about to leave the site. You also need to set up analytics as part of this build to identify sources of traffic and pages with high engagement and high bounce rates. We already have a HotJar account, so you will be expected to install HotJar for the site, and also Google Analytics. It is also critically important that the site performs very well - i.e. loading very quickly, solid transition animations, responsive on mobile, and that it is very well optimised for SEO - especially by leveraging the extensive CMS which covers a broad range of relevant topics for our target audience, since content marketing and inbound lead generation through lead magnet content will be a major arm of our marketing strategy. You will need to have experience in SEO to be hired for this job. Optimising the site's content for SEO will be the other major part of this project. The layout and design needs to be flawless and highly professional and with high fidelity to our existing brand style guide. The budget listed is the maximum for the project. Please do not send me proposals that exceed this budget, they will not be accepted. I like to work from Asana and I would hope this could be a rapid build job with a first draft of the site done within a week or two. Please apply by writing a short cover letter highlighting why you would be well suited to completing this project, based on your previous experience building high converting webflow sites for B2B SaaS businesses. In your message, please provide links to other relevant or comparable webflow sites you have built and designed, and confirm your availability to complete it in a short amount of time. For shortlisted candidates I will also send through some examples of websites I would like to emulate in terms of look and feel and certain layouts. Any questions don't hesitate to get in touch!

The ideal candidate will have strong skills in flowcharting, UI/UX design, and infographic creation. You will be responsible for developing a comprehensive flowchart that outlines the integration process and visually represents how the systems will interact. Project Overview: This project is extensive, enjoyable, and holds significant value for a large portion of the Medina population. Currently, no party has embraced the ideas I am presenting, and I lack the resources for it, relying on initiatives from like-minded colleagues. Consequently, I've taken the initiative to launch it through a personal website, with no current funding in place. Our goal is to utilize the project's outputs for presentations aimed at attracting development projects and securing the involvement of official bodies, investors, and various beneficiaries. The development project focuses on services related to the preparation, packaging, marketing, and export of agricultural crops, along with the coordination with other sectors, resources, and services. Our plan is to progressively develop its programming in the upcoming stages. Confidentiality and Communication: We emphasize the importance of maintaining confidentiality regarding commercial information associated with the project. Once an offer is submitted, it implies implicit approval and commitment to these confidentiality provisions. Communication will primarily occur through live audio and remote online meetings to ensure efficiency and effectiveness during this stage of the project. Project Scope: Our objective is to transform a set of information, processes, procedures, and systems into one integrated system through systems analysis. We aim to visualize the idea through a process flow chart, UX/UI design, and the integration of all elements into a comprehensive panel. The work involves: 1. Creating a complete process flow chart (UML). 2. Designing UX for all orders. 3. Designing UI for the home page, main section pages, and reports. 4. Merging all above elements (1,2, and 3) into one panel representing the integrated system. 5. Ensuring the templates and pages resemble the real system closely, without programming. Targeted Categories: The project involves various categories, including farmers, farms, crops, merchants, enterprises, suppliers, visitors, buyers, shipping, electronic stock exchange, agricultural materials market, agricultural services market, warehouses, trainers, consultants, and students. Design Details: The designer will receive identity and color guidelines but is responsible for collecting innovative images and icons systematically. The visuals will focus on representing the system without actual users or a control panel, providing a realistic visual representation for presentation purposes. Expected Outputs: The desired outputs include analyzing the system, creating a cloud of elements and their relationships, representing them with flowcharts and UML, producing interfaces for the entire platform, and providing digital, editable copies of source programs. All outputs should be arranged for use in presentations or videos, with the target language being English. Presentation and Collaboration: The project will be presented using Prezi, and the designer's role involves collecting the latest and best design to achieve the most effective representation. We'll collaborate on an unconventional approach to create a map of the development project system and its positive effects. Future Editing: It is essential for the designer to provide all source files to facilitate future editing as the project progresses through different stages."

Need to make a design for MVP of gaming app.,"['Mockup', 'Graphic Design', 'User Interface Design', 'Mobile App Design']",$150.00,"IOS Game Application Design Our firm is spearheading the transition of mainstream companies from Web2 to Web3 technologies. We are currently developing a custom application for a distinguished client, tailored for the iPhone 15 Pro. The design philosophy should reflect the Web3 Gaming aesthetic, focusing on the Play2Earn framework, with an emphasis on superior UX/UI design. We seek a minimalist yet innovative design approach, where bold, creative ideas are highly encouraged. The application will feature 3D characters, and we will provide comprehensive models for all characters and items. The existing logo is to be retained but will need re-creation in vector format. Designers are granted creative autonomy regarding the color scheme, though we suggest a preference for warm hues to ensure visual appeal. Significantly, we will supply PDF mockups of our preliminary designs to guide your creation process. These mockups should serve as a foundation, offering a clear direction while leaving room for your creative interpretation and enhancement. Description of each page: 1 - Home Page with Login: Retain the same buttons and text, with potential changes in their sizes and placement. 2 - Login Method Selection (Option chosen: Create New Account): Keep the same buttons and text, with possible adjustments to their sizes and locations. Company logos must remain unchanged, using official versions. The ""Activate Passkey"" logo can be modified but must be appropriate. 3 - Passkey Authentication (Option chosen: Login with Passkey): Maintain the same buttons and text, with potential alterations in their sizes and placement.

There should be a way to view different cryptocurrencies (either by scrolling or clicking an arrow to reveal the quantity of other tokens). The bottom part of the screen is open to your creativity (e.g., Staking/Transactions/P2P Betting/Referrals tabs were just examples; you should come up with something more interesting). Icons and colors on the lower panel can be changed while maintaining the style. 5 - Internal Wallet (Upcoming Events Section): Made accessible by swiping down - retain the same buttons and text, with possible changes in their sizes and locations. 6-7-8 - Inventory: Completely redesign the inventory for ease of use. Retain the collections Current Sleepwalker/Collections/Equipment (consider featuring Current Sleepwalker in a separate section). Include the ability to select items for the character (Screen 6), display the character's number (e.g., NFT #348489393), show the character's Level (e.g., Level 1), and detail attributes like Capacity/Mentality/Timing/Stability. Display the character‚Äôs ""Durability"" separately. In the Equipment section, include a filtering option by Categories (Headwear/Backpacks/Jackets/Gloves/Pants/Boots) and showcase various items. Also, depict a scenario where the inventory is empty. 9 - Display the Map (Scenario where the player is waiting for a portal to appear). Must include weather, a ""Geolocation"" button. Keep the same text. 10 - Scenario when a portal is detected. 11 - Scenario when the player reaches the portal and it can be opened. 12 - Screen when the portal is opening. Keep the same text. Illustrate a character emerging from the portal. There should be a crosshair for the user, and they must hold a button to assist the character. 13 - Character exits the portal. The player simply waits and watches. The character ""gathers moon energy"" (show this in action). Keep the same text. 14 - Character leaves after gathering energy. 15 - The portal explodes, releasing Portalit (our cryptocurrency). Use a special stone design for this. 16 - Mission completion screen - completely change the design. Keep the same text and buttons (a ""Continue"" button and a ""Share"" button). 17 - The map is displayed again, indicating when the fading portal will appear. 18 - Walking Activity section - keep the same text and buttons. 19 - Marketplace (simply change the design to match the common design code of all slides). 20-21 - Marketplace (examples of how items and characters will appear). 22 - Profile - essentially on the main page, include a ""back"" button.

For each chat room specified by JANE, relevant information about the users (whatever is visible, many of these data points may not be visible depending on the workspace settings) should acquired and presented in the output (columns of data): -Workspace name -Chatroom name -Full name -Display name -Title -Pronouns -Local time or local timezone (whichever is an easier datapoint to acquire) -Public Email address -Phone -Status -Timestamp of whenever the last DM between JANE and that user (regardless of who is sending party is) JANE does not need the spreadsheet to be in XLSX format a CSV with one user per row is fine. Or some other storage format that JANE can easily convert into a spreadsheet (JANE needs to be provided explicit instructions on how to do this) This doesn't need a good UI/UX to run, you can say ""Paste in current session token for the value SESSIONTOKEN on line 10 before you run this code"".

Extensive testing is not needed as long as there are enough error messages output explaining what went wrong (""Aborting enumeration of user CHARLES due to API request timeout, continuing to next user"")"
